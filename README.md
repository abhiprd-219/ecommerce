# Ecommerce Shop
### Step to be followed in this project:-



The website should have 5 pages:<br>
<b>Home Page</b><br>
<b>Item listing page</b><br>
<b>Single Item Page</b><br>
<b>Cart Page (hard code the items in the cart)</b><br>
<b>Checkout Page</b>

### Some pointers:

* Apply a mobile-first approach. Google this.
* Add README.md and .gitignore files to your repository.
* Make a common styles.css. Include it on each HTML page. Put the style classes here. They can be gradually reused.
* Work page by page, section by section, element by element. Break things down to the smallest step. Ask yourself what you don't know and figure it out.
* Get the project reviewed from time to time if you are not sure about something. This is will help save time.

* Complete the homepage and get it reviewed before doing other pages
